                            p It is most useful to have new recruits who are familiar with the sea, radio operation, navigation or first aid but, whatever your talent, we can put you to good use. Training is done after hours in the evening or on weekends. Standby for rescues is a 24/7 commitment, and best suited to people who live 10 minutes from a rescue base.
                            p Volunteering is not glamorous work. There is a lot of training and a whole lot of cleaning up involved. It can take anywhere from 6 months to 12 months before you will be ready for a real-life rescue. So, if you are thinking Baywatch, then you will have to think again. Team effort is essential.

                                p At NSRI, our volunteers take it one step further.  They do not sign up for ‘two hours on a Thursday’ – they commit to NSRI and agree to make themselves available to go at any time, any place, any how.
                                p They prioritise the needs of a stranger – so they will leave a business meeting or their brother’s wedding or their daughter’s first ballet show.  Not only this – but in addition, they agree to risk their lives.
                                p They will head to sea in the worst conditions – when everyone else is heading for home and battening down the hatches.

                            p If you prefer to stay on dry land you could help a rescue base with admin work, maintenance tasks or as the radio controller.  Each base would also appreciate a “mother” who is on hand with hot coffee and dry towels when they return from sea.

                            p Coastwatchers (usually retired folk who have a good view of the ocean from their homes) are an important part of the team as they act as “spotters”.  Special training and equipment is supplied.

                            p In terms of fundraising – it may seem a mindless task, but a street collection can raise around R40,000 for one morning’s work.  If you are humble enough to join us and shake a tin, we would love to have you.
